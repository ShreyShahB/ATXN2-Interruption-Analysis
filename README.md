#HOW IT WORKS

Put log and VCF files in same directory as this .py file. If using a txt file to hold all CHGVIDs, make sure each CHGVID is on a new line and in the same directory as .py file. Open this Python File in IDLE (Download Python 3.7 and up) and Run (Press F5). Type into the Shell that pops up with whatever it asks (Pressing Enter Key to Submit). Output will be a .csv file or printed in the shell - File Ouput Is the Same as Original Template.

Note:
VLOOKUP still require manual human support by linking target file to csv
